This is an attempt to model previous java version to this python version with better programming style.
Things still needed:
 * Need to redefine the data structure;
 * Need to redefine the component structure;
 * Need to find a proper agent modelling framework for python which would allow ACL communication;
   * There's MADKIT, although it is uncertain whether it supports python, whereas wiki states it and madkit website has broken links on that;
   * There's SPADE, although I need more time to analyze the code and documentation.
